## Installation

### Using Cargo

Ensure you have [Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system.

```bash
cargo install snipcli
```

### From Source

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snipcli.git
cd snipcli
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located at `./target/release/snipcli`. You can move it to a directory in your `PATH` for easier access:

```bash
cp ./target/release/snipcli /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use `snipcli` with various commands. Below are some examples to get you started:

### Add a Snippet

Save a new snippet with a title, language, description, and code file:

```bash
snipcli add --title "Quick Sort in Rust" --lang rust --description "Implementation of quick sort algorithm" --file quick_sort.rs
```

### List Snippets

List all saved snippets:

```bash
snipcli list
```

Filter snippets by programming language:

```bash
snipcli list --lang javascript
```

### Get a Snippet

Retrieve and display a snippet by its title:

```bash
snipcli get "Quick Sort in Rust"
```

Copy the snippet's code to the clipboard:

```bash
snipcli get "Quick Sort in Rust" --copy
```

### Delete a Snippet

Remove a snippet by its title:

```bash
snipcli delete "Old Snippet Title"
```

### Edit a Snippet

Modify an existing snippet:

```bash
snipcli edit "Quick Sort in Rust"
```

This command will open the snippet in your default editor for editing.

### Export Snippets

Export all snippets to a JSON file:

```bash
snipcli export --format json --output snippets_backup.json
```

Export snippets to a Markdown file:

```bash
snipcli export --format markdown --output snippets.md
```

### Import Snippets

Import snippets from a JSON or Markdown file:

```bash
snipcli import --file snippets_backup.json
```

### Search Snippets

Search for snippets containing specific keywords:

```bash
snipcli search "async function"
```

## Configuration

`snipcli` stores snippets in a JSON file located in the user's data directory. By default, it uses the appropriate directory based on your operating system (e.g., `$HOME/.local/share/snipcli/snippets.json` on Linux).

You can customize the storage path or other settings by modifying the configuration file or using environment variables (if implemented).
